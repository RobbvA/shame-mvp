# MVP Scope

## Hypothesis
Confrontational, escalating AI accountability increases habit logging consistency among discipline-oriented users compared to soft motivation.

## In Scope
- Manual habit logging (done / missed)
- Per-habit escalation
- AI-generated confrontation on failure only
- Configurable brutality level and persona

## Out of Scope
- Sensor tracking
- Gamification or rewards
- Social features
- Analytics dashboards
- Image or selfie input

## Core Loop
1. User defines a habit and deadline
2. Deadline passes
3. User logs done or missed
4. If missed:
   - Escalation increases
   - AI generates confrontation
5. System remembers state
6. Loop repeats
